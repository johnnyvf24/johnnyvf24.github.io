                                | By far one of the most impressive projects I have built to date is still up on chess.com 
                                a(href='https://www.chess.com/4-player-chess') here. 
                                | Recently graduated and while freelancing I was hired to integrate 
                                | my other project hellochess (also in this portfolio) into chess.com as a proof-of-concept.
                                | ofcourse the initial version was not nearly as refined as the current version
                                | but even then most of the core features were there including drawing arrows
                                | during Team games.
